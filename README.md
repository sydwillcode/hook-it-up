## Hook It Up!
The purpose of this lab is to accommodate you with the React Hooks API available in versions 16.8 and higher, to continue practice interacting and displaying information from an API, and to show off how up-to-date you are with React!

Steps
Setup
Create a new project with create-react-app
Delete the src and public directories
Create a new public directory with an index.html inside
Make a basic html document using the ! emmet command
Make sure it has one div with any id value you want (root is commonly used)
Create a new src directory with an index.js inside
Code the entry point for your entire <App /> in this file (just like what is initially generated)
Building a Webapp
Design Constraint: Only utilize useState and useEffect hooks, and code your webapp without using any class based components!!!
Use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ as a default REST API, or find your own for this lab if you're adventurous. ;)
Build a webapp using react-router-dom to have two routes
'/' the home route which will show a component with a preview list of all the objects in the endpoint of your choosing
'/:id/details' the details route which will show a component specialized in showing all the information for that object's id
